## Project Insight
- The Western region outperformed others in total sales, indicating strong market demand.  
- However, the Southern region struggled with profitability, suggesting a need for targeted promotions or pricing adjustments to improve performance.    
- The Furniture category had the lowest profit margins, with some subcategories generating negative profits due to high discounts.  
- Reducing excessive discounting could prevent revenue losses while maintaining customer interest.  
- corporate clients contributed the highest revenue, making them a key target for premium offerings and exclusive deals.  
- Individual consumers had more frequent orders but with lower basket values, meaning strategies like loyalty programs could encourage larger purchases.
- Same-day shipping led to increased repeat purchases, showing that investing in faster logistics could boost customer retention.
- Standard shipping had higher return rates, suggesting a need for better customer expectation management and quality checks.  


 ## Conclusion & Strategic Recommendations
- Adjust discount strategies, especially in low-margin categories like Furniture.  
- Allocate resources to regions with strong sales trends while exploring strategies for weaker markets.
- Prioritize corporate clients with tailored offers while encouraging individual customers to increase order sizes.  
- Optimize logistics to encourage faster deliveries while addressing return issues in standard shipping.
